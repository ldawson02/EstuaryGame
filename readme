Estuary Panic:

Our game is an exciting way to learn more about estuaries while keeping the user engaged with its fast-paced decision making and high stakes.The player acts as a blue crab trying to keep their estuary clean, working against time. THe crab must prevent harmful erosion by building either protective gabions or sea walls, while simultaneously picking up pollution and properly disposing of it. Sporadic power-ups and damaging natural disasters add a layer of variability and challenge that keep the player on their toes. We hope you enjoy learning more about estuaries while playing our game.
